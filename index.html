         <h2>The story</h2>

            <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.</p>
            <p>That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.</p>
            <p>They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</p>
            <p>The farmer said, “Maybe.”</p>

            <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,</p>
            <p>and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky.</p>
            <p>What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</p>
            <p>The farmer again said, “Maybe.”</p>
      
            <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.</p>
            <p>The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, “Maybe.”</p>
            <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.</p>
            <p>Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!”</p>
            <p>Again, he said, “Maybe.”</p>
      
            <br>

            <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,</p>
            <p>and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad</p> 
            <p>— because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;</p>
            <p>or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

         <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective.</p> 
            <p>Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas.</p>
            <p>Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
