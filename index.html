         <h2>The story</h2>

            <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
            That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
            They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
            The farmer said, <q class="farmer01"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>.</p>

            <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
            and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky!</q>.
            <q class="villagers">What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
            The farmer again said, <q class="farmer01"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>.</p>
      
            <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
            The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <mark class="bad">bad</mark>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer01"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>.
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
            Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q>
            Again, he said, <q class="farmer01"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>.</p>

            <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,</p>
            <p>and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <mark class="good">good</mark> or <mark class="bad">bad</mark></p> 
            <p>— because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;</p>
            <p>or, you never know what will be the consequences of <mark class="good">good</mark> fortune.</p>
